## üîß Technical Debt

### **Component Architecture Debt**
- **Issue**: Some components are becoming too large and complex
- **Files Affected**:
  - `AIAssistant.tsx` (200+ lines)
  - `Admin.tsx` (complex layout logic)
  - Several manager components
- **Impact**: Medium - Reduced maintainability
- **Solution**: Break into smaller, focused components

### **Type Safety Gaps**
- **Issue**: Some areas lack proper TypeScript typing
- **Areas Affected**:
  - Dynamic form handling
  - API response types
  - Event handlers
- **Impact**: Low - Potential runtime errors
- **Solution**: Gradual typing improvement

### **Styling Organization**
- **Issue**: Mix of inline styles, CSS classes, and utility classes
- **Impact**: Low - Inconsistent styling approach
- **Areas Affected**: Animation components, custom effects
- **Solution**: Standardize on Tailwind-first approach

### **Error Boundary Coverage**
- **Issue**: Limited error boundaries for component failure isolation
- **Impact**: Medium - Single component failures can crash entire sections
- **Solution**: Strategic error boundary placement

### **Performance Optimization Debt**
- **Issue**: Several performance optimizations not implemented
- **Specific Items**:
  - Image lazy loading not comprehensive
  - Bundle size optimization opportunities
  - Unnecessary re-renders in some components
- **Impact**: Low-Medium - Affects user experience on slower connections

### **Database Query Optimization**
- **Issue**: Some queries could be more efficient
- **Areas**:
  - N+1 query patterns in admin dashboard
  - Missing database indexes for common queries
  - Overfetching data in some components
- **Impact**: Low - Currently manageable with low traffic

### **Security Hardening Opportunities**
- **Issue**: Additional security measures could be implemented
- **Areas**:
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints
  - Input sanitization improvements
  - CSP headers optimization
- **Impact**: Low - Current security adequate but could be enhanced

## üîÑ Code Quality Issues

### **Inconsistent Error Handling Patterns**
- **Issue**: Different components handle errors differently
- **Impact**: Medium - Inconsistent user experience
- **Solution**: Standardize error handling approach

### **Dependency Management**
- **Issue**: Some dependencies may be outdated or unused
- **Impact**: Low - Bundle size and security implications
- **Solution**: Regular dependency audit and cleanup

### **Testing Coverage Gaps**
- **Issue**: Limited automated testing implementation
- **Impact**: Medium - Higher risk of regressions
- **Areas Lacking Coverage**:
  - Component unit tests
  - Integration tests for critical flows
  - End-to-end testing
- **Solution**: Gradual test implementation starting with critical paths

### **Documentation Debt**
- **Issue**: Inline code documentation could be improved
- **Impact**: Low - Affects long-term maintainability
- **Areas Needing Improvement**:
  - Complex function documentation
  - Component prop interfaces
  - API integration documentation

## üìà Monitoring & Observability Gaps

### **Error Tracking**
- **Issue**: Limited error tracking and monitoring
- **Impact**: Medium - Difficult to identify and fix issues proactively
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error logging

### **Performance Monitoring**
- **Issue**: No performance metrics collection
- **Impact**: Low - Unable to track performance regressions
- **Solution**: Implement performance monitoring dashboard

### **User Analytics**
- **Issue**: Limited user behavior tracking
- **Impact**: Low - Missing insights for product improvements
